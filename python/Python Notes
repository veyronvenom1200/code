Python Notes            *Pay attention to the small details on the exam

-Sorted and sort are different
    - Sort is for lists only, while sorted is for any iterable (including dictionaries).
    - When sorted is used with a dictionary, the dictionary is sorted by the key values (returns in a list).
    - sort(reverse = True) does not return a list; however, it does sort the list

    For instance:

    Correct:
    L = [(1,11),(2,22),(3,33),(4,44)]
    L2 = sorted([(i,j) for j,i in L],reverse = True)

    >>> print(L2)
    [(44, 4), (33, 3), (22, 2), (11, 1)]

-Shallow/Deep Copy
    - Shallow copy occurs when one object is set equal to another object
    (their memory ids are the same)
    - Deep copy is a new object with a seperated, different memory id
    - pay attention to if (in the funciton) a new variable is created or not

-Range
    -range can go from positive to negative (i.e. 1, -2) as long as the interval is also negative (-1 for instance)

-Class/methods
    -if class/method is called with out a value for the posititional argument, an error is returned

-Dictionaries
    -Dictionaries have no set value

-Index
    -if substring of index is not found, an error is printed ('substring not found')

-Set([iterable])
    -if object is in paramater, python will iterate over it (| union, ^ symdif)

-Str
    -str object does not support string assignment (ex. s[1:3] = 'oo')

-if
    -if x:  #checks to see if x is true or 1
